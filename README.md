### Dataset: [A-Z Handwritten Alphabets in .csv format](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)

## Overview
This repository contains all the codes and reference data for building the Handwritten Character recognition Model from scratch.

### Abstract
A Deep Learning Model for handwritten character recognition (A-Z).
The Dataset containg 26 folders from A to Z containing handwritten images in size 28*28 pixels, each alphabet in the image is centre fitted. Each Image is stored as Gray-level.
The feature extraction technique is obtained by normalizing the pixel values. Pixel values will range from 0 to 255 which represents the intensity of each pixel in the image and they are normalized to represent value between 0 and 1. Convolutional neural network is used as a classifier which trains the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format) dataset. The prediction for the given input image is obtained from the trained classifier.

### Further Improvement
* Real Time Character Recognition
* Better Image Processing such as: reduce background noise to handle real time image or images in different lighting conditions more accurately.

Feel Free to suggest an improvemet in this project.

This is a work from my 4th semester in Computer Enginnering from Saffrony Institute of Technology. Also I was assigned this project work from the Nano Degree course of [Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.elitetechnogroups.com/internship/best-course-for-autonomous-vehicle-using-advanced-ml-ai-iot.php) by [Elite Techno Groups](https://www.elitetechnogroups.com/) in April 2022.
